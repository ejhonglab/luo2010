-didn't i have plot settings to replicate the look of figure 1 C-H?
 uncommitted on my desktop or something? with other stuff?

-ways i could compare 1st PC to mean (to evaluate Ann's claim):
  -calculate angle between them / corr / dist
  -overlay in t-SNE / other 2 dimensional representation of the data

however, not sure any of those would really affect her argument. also, how
similar is this inhibition to what hers ultimately ends up being?
